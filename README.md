PBB is a web radio made by [Laurent GARNIER](https://www.laurentgarnier.com/), you can get more information from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_Garnier) or on different social media: (FB, Tweeter, Instagram).

The Web radio is called PBB, aka *Pedro Broadcasting Basement*. You can tune in via the following link https://pbbradio.com:8443/128. There are a few internet wrapper which can get you on the stream, but the coolest is the one from [Kdbuzz](https://www.kdbuzz.com/PBB) which provide you with the current track details.

I've received the php code to extract those information, and I'm planning to create a way to store a log of all tracks played... and maybe produce some stats and search features...
